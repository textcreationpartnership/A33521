         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Where they tell you that Chriſt was truly a Light before; and when he took upon him the form of a Servant, both before he appeared in a bodily ſimilitude in the likeneſs of ſinfull fleſh, and then alſo, and is Gods ſalvation to the ends of the Earth, which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends farther then his perſonal preſence did, though therein he did bear witneſs to the truth, to his inward and ſpiritual manifeſtation, to the new and living way. Friends, pray be not offended with me; to tell you the Serpent twinds about the Tree, to catch you in his deep deceit; for having told you that his appearing in fleſh, was to bear witneſs to his inward and ſpiritual appearing, which they that know him ſo, that know no man after the fleſh, that though ſo had known him, yet ſo know him no more, to make you believe they are ſome excellent things, fly aloft by telling you the real end of his coming in fleſh is known and reſerved in the ſpirit, which ſay you, he directed his unto, and in a caper, cry that his name was from everlaſting, and is to everlaſting; the Lord is one, and his name one,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:108680:3"/> receive it who can. Friends, I pray be not big worded out of the truth, I deny not but the ends of the coming of the Lord into the world, was to beget his Children into fellowſhip by communion with his Father and Himſelf, by giving to them his Life, which is mans Light, which my Brethren, being our Salvation, we have it by him who is our Saviour Chriſt Jeſus, who hath bought us to God by the price of his blood; and for the big words, the Lord is one, and his name one, receive it who can: we own it for ever, that our God is only one God; but this is as he is unmanifeſted; but as God is manifeſted, he is Father, Word, and Spirit; and although God is one, of whom are all things, yet there is the Lord Jeſus Chriſt by whom are all things, who is Mediatour betwixt God and man; and Chriſt, by whom is all things, being the word that was made fleſh, for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption of man, did the Fathers will in that body of fleſh, through the offering it up to the death of the Croſs by the Eternal Spirit, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as he ſaid, I will give my fleſh for the Life of the world, who giving it up unto death, reconciled us unto God by the body of his fleſh that taſted death, as ſaith the Scriptures; and although he is Everlaſting as he is the Word, yet as he was the man Chriſt, he was of time, according to the ſaying, <hi>Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee;</hi> which you find was when the Holy Ghoſt over-ſhaddowed <hi>Mary,</hi> which was ſaith <hi>Paul, When the fulneſs of time was come;</hi> and then made under the Law, made of a woman, for the end that we by him might be made the Adoption of Sons; wherefore ye children of men know, that the Scriptures declares not to any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for Chriſt, then to him the man Chriſt Jeſus our Lord, in whom the fulneſs of the Godhead dwelt bodily, which God-head is the Divine Nature; therefore your Opinion of his appearing for a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtation to his inward and ſpiritual appearance, and not for a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour for loſt man, is a miſtake of a dangerous concernment; and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſo fraudulently corrupted the truth, by a queſtion, that if Chriſt conſiſts of Body, Soul and Spirit, what conſiſted his Soul and Spirit of? Was that his body he recommended up unto his Fathers hand? Art thou a Preacher, and to ſeek what is Spirit, and what is ſoul; and what is Body, and yet wilt be a Preacher of immortal things? knows thou not how God hath tempered the Creature together, and how that man conſiſts, by make from nature, of eternity, and of time: from the eternal nature his Spirit and Soul, and from the temporary nature his body: do not preſume, for you have not the knowledge of the truth. But doſt thou ask if the Lords ſpirit was his body which he recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:108680:4"/> into his Fathers hands: Friends, had your Preachers not been in confuſion, they had without doubt not writ ſo confuſedly, and manifeſted themſelves ſo weak to ask ſo ignorant a queſtion; but for the truth ſake I ſhall explain; the ſoul of man is a ſpark of Gods Eternal Nature, coagulated into a Spiritual ſubſtance, for a center of his inſenſitive life, and as thus compacted, is a Creature of an Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal being, of an own ſelf-ſubſiſting conſiſtency, and having its abode in the life of time, is capable to be corrupted by infection from the life of time; but the Soul having the noble underſtanding in it, which men call reaſon, may by its ſpirit, that is, its will and underſtanding reject the infection of time, by repelling it from penetrating it, as it ſtands reſigned unto the life of the Divine Nature, which at firſt God breathed into it, by which it became a living ſoul, which being by it loſt by letting into it ſelf the Serpents poyſon, from the aſſault of the devil, fell from the Divine Nature into corruptible time, and conſequently into death; but God purpoſing to renew man unto the life of light, promiſes the Seed of the Woman for a breaker of the Serpents head, ſaying by the Prophet, that he would not for ever contend with man, for that his ſpirit would fail before him, and the ſoul that he had made. And do not we poor empty creatures find in our own ſouls, the anguiſh of darkneſs when we are diſtreſt, for want of the ſhining face of God, to beam upon our ſouls; and when his glances inſpires us by penetrating through our ſouls, how full of joy is our hearts; I need not write to the experienced, but will appeal unto thee that hath been afflicted and toſſed and made drunk with the cup of trembling from the Lord, who walked in darkneſs, and ſaweſt no light, in the day of thy ſpiritual diſtreſs, whether the light that was in thy conſcience gave thee thy aſſurance of thy ſalvation, or the breaking forth of his moſt marvellous light, that apprehended thee ere thou was aware? and did not the light in thy conſcience, before this day of God broke forth in thy ſoul, condemn thee in all that ever thou didſt, whoever thou art that haſt known the pangs of the new birth, and the adoption to the eternal life: I know thou muſt bear witneſs for me that I write the truth; for I ask thee, was it not the complaint of the Children of God from old, thou hidſt thy face and I was troubled, and prayed, Lord, ſhew us the light of thy countenance, for thou by it ſhall make us more glad, then they that by Oyl and Wine great increaſe have had; and was it not, and is it not ſo with thee at this preſent day? I ſay, if it be not, look to thy ſelf, for thou art fallen aſleep, and haſt loſt thy firſt Love; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:108680:4"/> it ſaith, tribulation and anguiſh upon every ſoul of man that hath ſinned, and the ſoul that ſinneth ſhall dye, which puts it out of doubt of the creaturality of the Soul; for the life of God could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver dye; but the ſoul of man died from it, as 'tis ſaid, You are dead in your ſins and treſpaſſes, for Gods life is the unchangeable life, and doth endure for ever; which life was in Chriſt, and to whom Chriſt gives it unto, it is in them, and is the light of man, which light of life the world receives not, for that this life that gives man to ſee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the deeps of God, is revealed unto man by inſpiration of Gods Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, as ſaid the ſpirit, ſearcheth all things, yea the deep things of God, which the world cannot receive, becauſe they believe not on him whom God hath ſent for a Saviour of the world, and for that cauſe they are carnal; which life of God is not, nor cannot be compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended by any thing, nor in any thing; for although it be in the Lord, yet, is it one with it ſelf as it is out of the Lord; and as it is one with it ſelf out of the Lord, ſo is it one with it ſelf in the Lord, for that it is his ſpirit, and the fulneſs that fills all in all; but mans ſpirit be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a comprehenſible Creature, is not infinite, but finite; and that is not it that ſearcheth the deep things of God as it is a created ſpirit, but in that it is created for an inſtrument in the hand of God, as God uſeth it in the hand of his ſpirit, it doth ſearch the inmoſt parts of his belly, as it is written, <hi>We are co-workers with Chriſt.</hi> And for the ſoul of Chriſt, that God would not leave in Hell, that was, of and from the ſoul-like properties of mans nature; as Chriſt conſiſts perſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally from his Mother <hi>Mary:</hi> and had it not been in kind of the nature of mans ſoul, it had little availed man what Chriſt had done by of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering his ſoul an offering for ſin: Thus have you it explained to you, what is mans ſoul, as alſo, that it is a creature in being, of and from Gods Eternal Nature, which nature being ſuperiour to the elementary ſenſe, hath that potent underſtanding in it ſelf, which men calls reaſon, which underſtanding hath, having in it an eye to diſcern into mans deeps, is the ſpirit of man that God put into man in the day of his Creation, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> being of the principle of light is a creatural ſpirit from the principle of light, as a ſpark of that nature; and as it is a ſpark, it is a formed ſpirit into a creature, and thence is comprehended as a creature, which having loſt its life by the tranſgreſſion of the man, as to God is dead, and not capable to break the bands of the ſoul without a helper which is Chriſt, in whom the Covenant of Grace that God hath made to man by Chriſts blood being incorporated, God hath promiſed to ſend it forth as the priſoner of hope; that is in the deep

But this Lord Jeſus through the guile of moſt of your Leaders is deny'd; and Jeſus being thus the Creation of God, is the only begotten of the Father, whom the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples ſaw and bore record unto, who being the Fathers delight, whom he foreſaw from Everlaſting, that he would ſend, when the fulneſs of time was come, promiſeth to him that the ſpirit ſhould reſt upon him, to make him of a quick underſtanding, the ſpirit of wiſdom and counſel, of might and knowledge, and the fear of the Lord, who being indued with the vertue of God, by which he pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out his ſoul unto God, in which travel knew of his juſtifying of many touching the body of our Lord this is the matter; you know he ſaith, that he proceeded from Heaven, and that his fleſh was meat indeed, and his blood was drink indeed, and that he would give his fleſh for the life of the world, and he that eates his fleſh, and drinks his blood hath Eternal Life; which body of our Lord being of the Heavenly ſubſtance, as it was circumſcribed, was the body of his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonality, that he gave for an offering for the Ranſom of the world, which body being of and from the nature of Heaven, he gave it, that we by it may have an intereſt through that body, into the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, the Kingdome the Father hath prepared for them that love him, and do believe on him whom God hath ſent. Thus have I gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven you an account of Jeſus, as to his Body, Soul and Spirit, who as he thus conſiſted was that form of God, and expreſs Image of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Subſtance, whoſe day the Patriarchs and Prophets ſaw in the Spirit and rejoyced to ſee, with whom the Apoſtles being converſers with, bore witneſs to him who is the truth, and to ſuch a one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion was made in all ages by the believers, till the coming of <hi>George Fox</hi> and his Diſciples; and being found in form and faſhion as a man, gave up his life into the grave of death, by which he broke open the grave of eternal death, by which he overcame him that had the

Firſt, let me tell you, your Queſtion is ill grounded; its foundation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but your own Opinion, and not the Scriptures bottom, nor it according to experience of faith; for as I have told you, the light the world is enlightned with, is not the light that the believers poſſeſs by gift of Chriſt from faith on his Redemption, but a light of reaſon man hath, as man is a rational Creature, from which his light hath knowledge of good or bad; as alſo knowledge from his light to eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chew evil, and to do good, in the doing either of which ſtands his wo or peace; but the light that is of grace is the receiving of the ſpirit of Chriſt, that doth give power to become the Sons of God, which the world he ſaid could not receive, the reaſon, becauſe that they believed not on me; therefore the world not having the ſpirit cannot wait in the ſpirit, and indeed how ſhould they wait in that they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver had? therefore the light in man being but the light of man, as man is a rational Creture, ſinking into it for the manifeſtation of the ſalvation that comes from grace by Covenant from God by Jeſus Chriſt, is a Doctrine that turns away the Creature from Chriſt the Redeemer <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

But my Brethren, you are bought with a price, not of blood of Bulls and Goats, nor Heifers of a year old, but by the blood of God; for you know, that it is written, that faith comes by hearing, and hearing of the word of God; but how ſaith he, ſhall they hear without a Preacher, and how ſhall they preach without they be ſent?

<pb n="21" facs="tcp:108680:12"/> concluſion is, that he that believeth ſhall be ſaved, but he that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth not is condemned already. Now then Chriſt as he is the word and maker of all things, is not the light in conſcience, but the word that was God, and with God, without whom nothing was made that was made, in him was life, and the life was the light of men, and he it is that enlightens every man that comes into the world; now mark, here is the word in whom is the life, which life is the light of men; and this word is God that enlighteneth every man that comes into the world, which word being the womb that the life is in: the word is one thing, &amp; the light another, which light of men being but an efflux of the life in the word, is not the word, nor is it God, for that it is but a propertie ſent forth from him the word, who being goodneſs it ſelf, ſends forth his love into the heart, to wit his life, which ſhed in the heart, is to the heart a light, and this he calls his ſpirit, of which he gives his Children to partake at times for relief in their pilgrimage ſtate, which light is not Chriſt, though of his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, no more then the light of the Sun, is the Sun it ſelf: And if the light in conſcience, as you ſay it is, be Chriſt, then ſo many men as are in the world, ſo many Chriſts.</p>
            <p>For that that is in conſcience is circumſcribed by conſcience; and if circumſcribed a diſtinct part from the whole, as a tree whoſe womb is the Earth out of which it comes forth a tree, as a tree, a diſtinct particular from the earth in its own particular root, from whence it hath its growth; ſo that the light in conſcience is not Chriſt, no more then the beam of the Sun that incorporates with the radical moiſture of the earth is the Sun; but I am not ignorant whereto this opinion tends. Now then, Chriſt as he is the word and maker of all things, is called God, but in that he hath the power to give out of himſelf life that is in himſelf, promiſes to give forth out of himſelf his life, which is his ſpirit, to them that do believe on him, which life, as before told you, is the light of men; which life when beam'd into mans heart, no more abides to the ſatisfying of the heart, then while it is a living motion, which when the word with-holds his breathing, as to the cretures ſenſe is dead: as you have an inſtance in fire, which you ſee lies in the wood, but till the wood be ſet on fire, the fire doth not appear, and thence the wood gives no warmth, and when the wood is kindled that the fire flames forth, you ſee it doth no longer abide then it hath matter, for when the wood is burnt the fire goeth out: and who of you that have experience that knoweth not the thing I ſpeak; therefore the light in conſcience, not Chriſt,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:108680:13"/> though a meaſure of his nature, for as the fire lies occult in the wood, and is not manifeſt; ſo is it with the light in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, which lies in conſcience as dead, till quickened by Chriſt from motion by his ſpirit; and hence my concluſion is, that the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of man being his internal light, hath no more power to give ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation to the ſoul, then the ſoul hath to ſave it ſelf; but in that it being a ſparkling glimps in the ſoul, doth convince the ſoul of what is good, and what is done amiſs, which diſcerned by the ſoul, ſerves for a director to the ſoul, to go to Chriſt where only lies its help; which ſpirit of man, ſaith the Scriptures, is the candle of the Lord, by which he ſearcheth the inmoſt parts of his belly, which ſpirit or light in man coming down with every man from <hi>Adam</hi> by Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is the inſtinct in Nature, that doth incline the creture naturally to call on God, the inſtance hereof we have in Babes, that when themſelves can expreſs in their mouths, is found the Name of God; which being but the light of nature in that mans ſpirit, is a being from nature, and not the light of life that Chriſt gives to his Saints through their believing on his name; and if ſo, it had been that the light in conſcience had been Chriſt that could have ſaved them, and given to them the power to become the Sons of God, it had been little to us the promiſe of God to ſend his ſpirit to us for another comforter. Be not deceived, this light of conſcience cannot lead the follower of its dictates farther then unto its own center, which is the center of Nature, and its power felt; but the power of the center of nature, and if you was not ſo highly exalted from your own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits, you might come to a underſtanding of your ſpirits, and the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of your life being from the property of fire; thence tis you caſt forth flames from out of your mouths to devour all that doth oppoſe you in your errours. And for your attributing to the light in every mans con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience the power to give wiſdom, righteouſneſs, ſanctification &amp; <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption;</hi> let me tell you, is a <hi>doctrine</hi> not what declared by <hi>Scriptures,</hi> nor known by the experimental traveller that waits for the ſalvation of God, and your aſſertion that by believing in it the power known, and the feeling it the witneſſing the breaking of the Serpents head, is a Doctrine that nulls the purpoſe of God, in ſending Chriſt the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans ſeed, who was the breaker of the Serpents head, who had he not broke it when he was in this world in a body of fleſh, could not have been broken by all what that man could do; and if your do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine be true, the Scriptures falſe, and God made by Chriſts Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles lyers, and Chriſt ſuffered for man in vain; but God is juſt, his
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:108680:13"/> Scriptures true, his Apoſtles juſtified in his ſight; but it being a ſo heterogene doctrine, that all men in whom there is the faith will ſee through it, I leave it to the condemnation of the Truth.</p>

<pb n="25" facs="tcp:108680:14"/> ſaid the Lord to <hi>Thomas,</hi> Thou haſt ſeen and felt, and haſt believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but bleſſed are they that have not felt nor ſeen, and yet do believe; and having promiſed to them to ſend his Spirit to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due them with power, leads them to <hi>Betheny,</hi> and bleſſed them, which while he was doing, was taken up into Heaven in their ſight; by which diſcourſe it doth appear, that Chriſt was not the light in his perſon, but Chriſt as he was perſonally in his body of fleſh, to whom <hi>John</hi> bore witneſs, as the Lamb of God that took away the ſins of the World: by which it doth appear that this fiction that ſayes, the light in Chriſt is Chriſt, and not Chriſt the Chriſt in his perſon, is a denying Chriſt come in fleſh, and to be fear'd that Anti-chriſt foretold by <hi>John,</hi> that was to come, and the affirming the blood of Chriſt not that that did Atone with God for ſinful man, the trampling under foot the blood of the Covenant, making it an unholy thing, doing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpite to the ſpirit of Grace, by which we are ſanctified. But this being ſo ridiculous a fiction is condemned of old by the Scriptures; and this ſo great an errour hath riſen amongſt us by changing the name, by which we onely can be ſaved, to the change<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the truth; but in that it doth appear that Chriſt is Chriſt, as he was in the form of our perſons, a Saviour, and by that form Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation for man hath wrought your principles, that the light in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience every man born into the world hath is Chriſt, is out of Truth, and that it is that convinceth him of ſin doth manifeſt you deny the Chriſt of God; but ſaith the Lord, I go away, and will ſend the ſpirit, and he that ſhall convince the world of Sin, of Righteouſneſs, and of Judgement; of Sin, becauſe they believe not on me; of Righteouſneſs, becauſe I am gone to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; of Judgement, becauſe the Prince of this World is caſt out. Now if the Light in Conſcience be the Spirit, then muſt every man have Chriſts Spirit, that comes into the world; And whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Chriſt that ſaith, his Spirit the world cannot receive, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they believe not on me, or you, are to be believed in this point, I commit to be conſidered of by men, and ſay this, that the attending upon the light in Conſcience, for the Chriſt leads not to Chriſt, neither is it his Spirit, for the Spirits work in man is to lead man out of himſelf, and all depending on himſelf to Chriſt, and to a depending on Chriſt, that by him the wounded ſoul may obtaine
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:108680:15"/> peace in God our Father, in and by our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who is the propitiation for our ſins, according unto the Holy good pleaſure of our Righteous God, who gives his Spirit to them that aske him by Faith on his beloved Son. Now that Chriſt himſelf and his Spirit is not one, you ſee by his words, that ſpeaks of himſelf, as one, and of the Spirit as another; I go away, but I will not leave you comfortleſs alone; I will ſend you another Comforter, the ſpirit of Truth, and he ſhall take of mine, and give it unto you; and why ſaith Chriſt, I ſay of mine, it is becauſe the Father hath given to me all that he hath; Mark, here is the Father that gives all to the Son, and here is the ſpirit that takes from the Son, and gives to Chriſts believers; here is three, the Father, Son and Spirit, the Father the Giver, the Son the Receiver, the Spirit the Diſpenſer, to men, the Father the good will, the Son the doer of his good will, the Spirit the Reward to them that ſet their Seal that God is true, who hath ſent his Son into the World, from the love he bore the world, that they might not periſh, but have ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting life; and unto Chriſt, ſaith the beloved <hi>John,</hi> there are three that bare Record in Heaven, Father, Word and Spirit, and theſe three are one, both in reſpect of conſent in their te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies; as alſo in reſpect of their eternity of being, who being a ſubſtance of ſo tranſcendent a clarity of ſpiritual ſubſiſtencie, which neither eye hath ſeen nor ear hath heard, neither hath it entred into the heart of man to know, but as to him its given by the Son who reveals him, who determining with himſelf to manifeſt himſelf, he the all-nothingneſs becomes the al-ſomething<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to his own manifeſtation, who having wil'd a being to bring to paſs that that he had wil'd, attracts in his will a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire for a center of the all-things, that he the will, in his all-ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingneſs did foreſee from Eternity, and having by his deſire aſtringe the matter for a corporal form into a nature for production of cretures, ſpeaks forth the model by his word, who effects by power, to wit, his Spirit, the Univerſe with cretures in their diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities and variety of colours and ſhapes, which being the truth, that thouſands of the Quakers that are ſo called, I hope do believe, do hope the wiſdome of the Powers, and all good and religious men, will keep up a charity, to the good, not imputing to them the errours of the wicked, for that you know that in the
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:108680:15"/> ſoundeſt bodies, oft it happens, there breaks forth a Boyle: But to my Diſcourſe, whoſe buſineſs is to clear the point, that Chriſt without us is Saviour, and not the light in conſcience, that you ſay is Chriſt; to that end, turn to the Queſtion the Lord puts to <hi>Peter,</hi> who ſaith <hi>Peter,</hi> whom ſay the people I am? his Reply to his Lord, Some ſayes thou art <hi>Elias,</hi> ſome <hi>Jere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah,</hi> or ſome of the Prophets; <hi>but ſaith the Lord unto</hi> Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, whom ſay'ſt thou that I am? <hi>Peter</hi> makes Anſwer, Thou art Chriſt the Son of the Living God. The Lord replyes to <hi>Peter,</hi> and declared him bleſſed, for that fleſh and blood had not revealed it unto him, but my Father that is in Heaven: See, 'twas Chriſt that ſpake to <hi>Peter,</hi> as in perſon without him, and not the Light Chriſt that ſpake to <hi>Peter</hi> from within him, and that that revealed Chriſt to <hi>Peter,</hi> that Chriſt was the Son of God, not his light in his Conſcience, but the Father that is in Heaven, 'tis time you wake from ſleep, and come to the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging of the truth, for unto us there is left no excuſe; take heed, ſtumble not, leaſt you fall backward: Surely my Friends, from the beginning of <hi>Geneſis</hi> to the end of the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations</hi> the Scriptures concern themſelves to bear witneſs to him who is the Truth, the man Chriſt Jeſus, and our Lord the Lords Chriſt, and our Saviour, and unto him confeſs; I, to the Glory of God our Father, and our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.

            <p>From <hi>Page</hi> the ſeventeenth to the nineteeth, charge not my Pen to return to what there wrote, for that I will not be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vok't, but refer the Reader to the paper, which examining, will find the Truth againſt your Oppoſition to its Poſition, That the Chriſt of God that Redeemed man was him that was born of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> and perſonally came into the world in fleſh, and not the light of Creation in the Conſcience, which you ſay is Saviour, Redeemer, Advocate, and the Chriſt; but if my former paper wanted explaining, I hope that this will clear the point; but what is aſſerted of mine that you bring a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt me for to juſtifie you in your invictiveneſs, in that I have declared the Truth, ſatisfie my ſelf in Gods reward, being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented to be reviled, without reviling again, knowing that if they call'd the Maſter of the Houſe <hi>Beelzebub,</hi> you will call his

Brethren, I will aske your ſelves, if that it was not at all times my manner of Diſcourſe, when at any time, as occaſion offered, that I did not as well acknowledge the Soveraignty of the Lord, in the new re-generation, as I did the ſufferings of the Lord for our Salvation; and ſhould I have denyed the one, by only crying up the other; I ſhould have been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved by my Maker, but in this I rejoyce, that God hath pleaſed of his Grace, to give to me of all men moſt unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to underſtand the whole Truth, to which I bore Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny in the paper; For that if it be as you ſay, that the light whereof every man that comes into the world be Chriſt and Saviour, and not Chriſt that was born of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> as he was in perſon, then the Scriptures Teſtimony of him are not true, and his Apoſtles are found Lyers before God, in that they are they that teſtifie to him; ſee <hi>Luke</hi> the firſt and ſecond Chapters; <hi>Paul</hi> in all his Epiſtles, as alſo all the Apoſtles in their Acts Recorded, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> the 7<hi>th,</hi> the 14<hi>th</hi> verſe: <hi>Iſa.</hi> the 9<hi>th,</hi> and verſe 6. To us a Child is born, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us a Son is given, and the Government ſhall be upon his ſhoulders, and his Name ſhall be called wonderful Counſellour, the Mighty God, the Everlaſting Father, the Prince of peace; is not this he that came from <hi>Boſrah,</hi> whoſe garment was died red; and is not this Chriſt whoſe Garments was ſtained with his blood, when pierc't with <hi>Longinos</hi> his ſword, if ſo, not the light in conſcience, but the babe born; you ſay, that the Goſpel by which we are ſaved, is the power you feel; the Scriptures ſay, the ſufferings of Chriſt is the Goſpel, and the power of God by which we are ſaved, <hi>Corinthians</hi> the firſt

<pb n="30" facs="tcp:108680:17"/> once to dye, but after death to come to Judgment: So Chriſt was once offered to bear the ſins of many, and unto them that look for him, ſhall he appear the ſecond time without ſin unto ſalvation, <hi>Hebrews</hi> the 9<hi>th,</hi> the latter end of the Chapter; If ſo the Scriptures True, your Doctrine is out of Truth, That ſayes, Patriarks and Prophets had Salvation by the Light in their Conſciences, ſince that was but the hand that guided them to him that was to come, that purified all by blood, without which no remiſſion; therefore not the light in conſcience the Chriſt and Saviour, but he that of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered up himſelf a living Sacrifice for the putting away ſin; you ſay that you are beyond Faith; but ſay I, was you ever in it? if you had, and received the Promiſe upon your be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving, ſure you would have held out unto the end, that you might have been ſaved; but you turning away to another Chriſt, and another Goſpel, then the ſufferings of Chriſt ſhows you, either never had the Faith of the Lord Jeſus, or that you are Apoſtatized from it, for the Scriptures ſay, that we are kept by Faith through the Mighty Power of God unto Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. The <hi>Galathians</hi> Witch-craft, that having received the Spirit, by the hearing of Faith, the Concition bewitcht them to another Goſpel, Obedience to the Law; you ſay, that the Soul of man is no creture; the Scriptures ſaith, What will it profit thee to gain the whole World, and loſe thy owne ſoul, and thou fool, This night ſhall thy ſoul be taken from thee; and ſaith God, I will not for ever contend with man, nor be wroth, for the ſpirit would fail before me, and the ſoul that I have made; ſo that ſay I unto you, O you chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of men, is it I that deny the Chriſt of God, or is it you that ſay, he the Word that was made fleſh, is not Chriſt and Saviour? but that is he that was in that Chriſts perſon, which you call Light, ſaying, that a meaſure of it is in the Conſcience of every man that comes into the world, and thence affirm, that he was but a manifeſtation for our Example, as ſaith <hi>Solomon Eccl.</hi> and <hi>J.
